# Nodepop API

This API, named Nodepop, is the final project for the backend with Node.js course at my program in bootcamp by KeepCoding and Glovo. We have been requested to create an API using Express and mongodb that allows the creation, edition, deletion and filtering of pieces of advertisements that follow a specific information schema (item name, photo, price, tags, and whether the item is available for purchase or for selling). It also allows to store the information in a mongodb database.
If you like it, feel free to fork it and give it a try.

## Install mongodb

Having mongodb installed in your server is necessary for the API to work. Just download it, install it and make sure it's running in your system.
https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

The database will run at `mongodb://127.0.0.1/nodepop` by default. You can change this in `lib/connectMongoose.js` at line 14.

## Deploy

    npm install

## Load initial data to database

The database will be overwritten with the data in `adverts.json`.

    npm run init-db

## Start the application in production

    npm start

## Start the application for development

    npm run dev

The API will run at `http://localhost:3000` by default. You can change the port in `/bin/www.js` at line 15.

### Make sure to be at the **src folder** directory when executing these commands.
